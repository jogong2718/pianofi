## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

PianoFi is built with a modern microservices architecture designed for scalability and performance.

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, OpenSheetMusicDisplay (OSMD)
- **Backend**: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Supabase Auth
- **AI Models**: AMT-APC and PiCoGen (finetuned piano transcription models)
- **Audio Processing**: FluidSynth, FFmpeg, midi2audio
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS (ECS, Fargate, EC2, S3), Stripe

## üöÄ Development

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- AWS CLI configured with SSO

### Local Setup

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jogong2718/pianofi.git
    cd pianofi
    ```

2.  Create necessary environment files based on the examples:

    - `frontend/.env.local`
    - `packages/pianofi_config/.env`

3.  Log in to AWS SSO profile:

    ```bash
    ./dev-start.sh
    ```

    This script will also start the development environment using Docker Compose.

4.  The services will be available at:
    - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
    - Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Deep Dive

### Model Workers and acknowledgements

- **AMT Worker**: Optimized for faster transcription with excellent musicality. Runs on AWS Fargate for cost-effective, serverless scaling.
- **PiCoGen Worker**: Provides higher note and timing accuracy, ideal for complex piano pieces. Requires GPU and runs on dedicated EC2 instances within an ECS cluster.

### Data Flow

1.  User uploads an audio file from the frontend.
2.  Frontend requests a pre-signed upload URL from the backend.
3.  The file is uploaded directly to an AWS S3 bucket.
4.  Backend creates a job in the database and enqueues it in Redis, targeting the appropriate worker (AMT or PiCoGen).
5.  The designated worker picks up the job, downloads the audio from S3, and performs AI transcription.
6.  The worker generates a MIDI file, converts it to MusicXML, and synthesizes a preview audio file (MP3).
7.  All generated artifacts are uploaded back to S3.
8.  The backend is notified, and the job status is updated in the database.
9.  The user sees the completed transcription in their dashboard and can view, play, and download the files.
